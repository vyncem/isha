# isha-offering-sessions

Automation of the management of Free offering session management. Motivated by:

1. GDPRS
  1. phasing out of guest cards
1. Scaling up of free offering sessions ~10 per month


## Procedure
1. Guests register on Eventbrite
1. Guests marked as attended or missed on Eventbrite after session
1. Thank you emails sent to attendees
1. Missed you emails sent to missed
1. Stats of numbers and locations sent to Isha

## Considerations
1. Localisation and Internationalisation of emails
1. Configurability of automation, e.g.
  1. Turn specific session email sending off
  1. Specify time of emailing

## Dev

## Dockerization
###Â playground
`docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app python:2.7 bash`

## Without Docker
1. Place all required keys in setup-api-keys.py file.
1. Replace password in securekeys.py for encrypting keys
1. Run setup-api-keys.py this will create 'config' file which will contain all encrypted keys
1. Run compile.py to compile all python scripts
1. Copy compiled pyc files and c'onfig' file to the location where you want to run scripts
1. Edit run_free_offering_email.sh file and put appropriate location in FREE_OFFERING_WORKSPACE environemnt variable. This location will contain all compile pyc fils, config file and this location will also constain events.log file for script logs
1. Now you can run script using by running run_free_offering_email.sh file

## Setup Cron job to run script 3 times a week
1. Setup cron job to run run_free_offering_email.sh script using following command
  1. crontab -e
  2. Copy this in crontab file '0 22 * * 1,3,5 ~/free-offering/run_free_offering_email.sh'


### production
`docker build -t eb .`

`docker run -it --rm -e EVENTBRITE_TOKEN=$EVENTBRITE_TOKEN -v $DATA:/data eb`

### Env
1. [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and `.python-version` used to track python version.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages.

### Test
- To run tests type `behave` in the root directory
- BDD using [Behave](https://github.com/behave/behave)
- Simplify and seed up http request using [VCR](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy)
